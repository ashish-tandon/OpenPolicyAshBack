# OpenPolicy Dashboard Deployment Status

## 🚀 Deployment Summary

### Frontend (Dashboard) - Ready for Vercel
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ Environment variable support configured
- ✅ API URL can be configured via `VITE_API_URL`

### Backend (API) - Requires Container Platform
Due to the complexity of the backend services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, OPA), Vercel cannot host the full backend. You'll need to use:
- Railway (recommended)
- Render
- AWS ECS
- Or any Docker-compatible hosting
